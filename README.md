1. extract 1D-MFEP from metadynamics simulations with path CVs using 2D-free energy surface obatined at the end of the simulations
2. extract MFEP trajectory from the simulations using COLVAR file and mfep-profile genertaed in 1
3. Block averaging for error estimation using HILLS and COLVAR (generated assuming constant bias using .xtc file) files
